To be clear, is this implementation the simplest possible machine learning of the collision operator? For example, is there necessary distinctions between the populations versus just treating the entire structure as one state, similar to as stated in the original notes: $\vec{x} \rightarrow N_x \times N_y \times N_z \times (19 + 19)$

### 1. Simplest possible ML view of the collision operator

For a **first-pass, proof-of-concept model**, you can absolutely treat each lattice point as
[
\vec{x};\mapsto; N_x \times N_y \times N_z \times (19 + 19)
]
—that is, just **one big state vector of 38 channels per site** (19 for f, 19 for g).
Nothing forces you to keep the two populations separate in the first model.

* **Why this is simplest**

  * A single feature vector of length 38 per site (or per small neighborhood) is the smallest well-defined input.
  * One baseline network (or even ridge regression) can map directly from 38 inputs → 38 outputs (the Δ’s or next state) with no extra book-keeping.

* **Physics still respected**

  * You can enforce conservation (mass/momentum) across the combined 38 outputs by simple constraints or loss penalties.
  * If later analysis shows different physics for f vs g (e.g., distinct relaxation times), you can split the channels later without breaking the first model.

This is exactly the spirit of your original notes—start with the simplest “all-in-one” representation and add structure only when performance or physical fidelity requires it.

### 2. Fit to the current plan (v1.1)

* Section 3 of the plan already lets you define the input window as **“single-site (38 channels)”** and the learning target as **Δᵢ increments**.
* D2.5 will still produce one trained model + metrics if you simply flatten f and g into one vector at each lattice site.
* You can skip any population-specific branching in the code and just make the data loader output `(num_samples, 38)` arrays.

That makes **D0 simpler**: just confirm grid size and channel count, then flatten to `(num_points, 38)`.

### 3. Recommendation

Yes, you can now ask Claude Sonnet to **implement D0** using the simplified representation:

> “Treat each lattice site as one state of shape (38,) — combine f and g channels into a single vector — and detect Nx,Ny,Nz from headers. Produce the discover_specs.py script, metrics, and docs accordingly.”

Sonnet can follow those instructions easily: it just needs to

* parse headers to get lattice size and channel count,
* flatten the 38 channels per site, and
* compute simple per-channel statistics and conservation checks.

✅ **Bottom line**
For the first-pass training and reporting you’ve planned, **one combined 38-channel state is the simplest valid approach**. It satisfies your original (\vec{x}\rightarrow N_x\times N_y\times N_z\times(19+19)) idea and still allows all the metrics and conservation checks in the v1.1 plan.
